<h2 class="pad">About</h2>
<p class="pad">Lydia Samuelson is an English and Technical Communications major from Des Moines, IA.
She aims for a balanced education. While she has a heart for English, her passion is 
forging connections between what she knows and what she has yet to learn. She feels 
Technical Communications is a way to diversify her learning while synthesizing 
information to help others.</p>
<p class="pad">In her free time, Lydia enjoys hiking, crafting with pyrography and polymer clay, 
reading, and writing. Her thirst for learning has led her to pick up many tricks and 
hobbies (such as knife-throwing and beekeeping), and she is always on the lookout 
for more.</p>

<h2 class="pad">What Iâ€™m Doing</h2>
<p class="pad">Lydia is currently a junior with plans to extend her education through
graduate school, specifically the MFA in Creative Writing and Environment at Iowa State 
University. Her goal is to leave ISU with a book published, experience in editing, 
and the skills to educate others.</p>
<p class="pad">Outside of class, Lydia is active in many extracurriculars. She acts as 
President of Barton Anders Honors House to plan community events and improvements. 
In Sketch Literary Journal, Lydia is the non-fiction board editor as well as a 
fiction board member. Recently, she has taken up the task of exploring the many 
hidden corners of the ISU campus. Her greatest discovery is a German math textbook 
from 1812.</p>
